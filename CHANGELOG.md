## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Prevent removed accounts from reappearing after managed-home discovery on macOS and Windows
- Recover stale managed account credentials from newer matching auth homes before surfacing refresh-token errors
- Decode Plus account credit balances when the Codex usage API returns `credits.balance` as a string
- Keep distinct provider account IDs separate even when accounts share the same email or auth subject

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Windows account switching now syncs `.codex-global-state.json` and `.codex-global-state.json.bak` creator IDs when replacing the active account
- Windows restart flow now backs up and restores Codex Desktop MSIX session state under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\OpenAI.Codex*`
- Regression coverage for Windows account switching, global state rewrites, and desktop session handoff
- Windows account-switching fix notes under `windows/ACCOUNT_SWITCH_FIX.md`

### Changed

- Replaced the repository Windows implementation with the validated fixed Windows source from the working build
- Updated release metadata, landing page references, and documentation for `1.1.3`

### Fixed

- Windows account switching after recent Codex Desktop updates, where copying only `auth.json` could leave Codex Desktop on a stale session or login screen

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- Windows packaged account switching so the hidden PowerShell restart helper no longer uses `DETACHED_PROCESS`, which previously prevented Codex Desktop from relaunching after a switch
 
## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Windows-side presentation logic tests covering active account detection and practical quota sorting
- Tracked Windows build assets for the packaged tray application icon and preview image

### Changed

- Synced the Windows app from the latest stable `CodexControl-dev` implementation
- Updated release metadata and direct download references to `1.1.1`

### Removed

- Sparkle-based macOS update plumbing, appcast generation, and the in-app update action

### Fixed

- Windows active-account logic so shared provider IDs do not incorrectly mark multiple accounts as active

- Sparkle bootstrap and appcast generation scripts for local signed release preparation

### Changed

- Replaced the previous blue Orbit Dial mark with the dark, green, and red production brand

- Embedded Sparkle.framework into the packaged macOS app bundle

### Fixed

- macOS packaging so Sparkle's framework and helper bundle are copied into the app
